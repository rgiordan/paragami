## To release a new version,

# Make a tag
git tag v0.x
git push origin v0.x

# Make a wheel
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

# Upload to pypi.  Note that autograd doesn't install correctly on test.pypi.org,
# so paragami will not install correctly from test.pypi.org, even when it will work
# on pypi.
twine upload dist/*v0.x*

# Check installability in a virtual environment!

## To make a single rst file, run something like

sphinx-build -b html -d _build/doctrees . _build/html api/sensitivity_functions.rst
