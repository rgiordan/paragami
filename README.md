## Description.

Much of the old `paragami` has been made obsolete by developments in `jax`
and tensorflow probability, particularly PyTrees.

However, there is still some useful functionality here.  I'm particularly
keen to 
  - Easily manage and differentiate my own bijectors
  - Easily wrap function input and output, including preconditioning
  - Have safe, boilerplate serialization

I'll update for a more modern era in this branch.



\*  Thanks to St√©fan van der Walt for the suggesting the package name.
